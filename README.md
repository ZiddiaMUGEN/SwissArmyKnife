SAK converted and updated for current MUGEN versions. Supports WIN, 1.0, 1.1a4, 1.1b1

The original SAK was developed by an unknown Japanese developer, and was translated to English by Vans. I have only updated this tool for newer MUGEN versions and added/fixed some features.

New features compared to the original SAKWM include:
- More debug colors + customizable debug colors
- Support for non-hardware breakpoints to dodge antivirus
- Trigger breakpoint support for 1.0+
- Char folder iteration (temp disabled due to antivirus freaking out)
- Full AssertSpecial flag output
- Clsn1 detection
- LocalCoord display

DebuggingDLL.dll compiled from https://github.com/SymbolSource/Microsoft.Samples.Debugging
